Constraints:

- AMD for a better value/price ratio (and fâ€¦k Intel ðŸ‘¿)
- TDP < 100W for a low consumption, moderate efficiency server
- 6 cores, 12 threads for a standard CPU with sufficient load capacity
- Frequency > 3GHz for adequate performances
- Socket AM4, for great compatibility with motherboard
- Integrated GPU is a nice to have, but not needed with a dedicated card
- ECC as a nice to have if no big price difference, and depending on compatibility

### RAM

Constraints:

- Final objective is to max out the 128 GB that our CPU can handle, so we will look for 4 32GB
- For 4 lanes, our max frequency will be 2666 for our CPU
- UDIMM DDR4
- ECC is still a nice to have

### GPU

To reduce consumption, we will focus on an integrated graphic processor instead of an external device. However, having the possibility to add one to the build will be ensured (need one slot of PCIe 4.0 x16).

### Storage

Assuming an array of 4 disks, 1 for parity and 90% of effectiveness. Use of CMR over SMR or HM-SMR recommended.
