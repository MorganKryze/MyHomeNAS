### Build requirements

[WIP]

| Component | Description | Price Estimate | Quantity | Total Estimate | Links |
| --------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------- | -------------- | ----- |

Base budget (without storage): **~...€**

Complete budget (with 2x1To SSDs): **~...€**

### Extras

These components are not part of the build itself but are useful to have for the setup and operation of the NAS.

- **Router & ethernet cables**: your home router from your ISP can do the job, ethernet connectivity is preferrable than wifi for reliabality and performance.
- **Monitor and keyboard**: only needed for the initial setup if you don't want to do it headless via SSH, or as an alternative to find the IP address of the Raspberry Pi on your network.
